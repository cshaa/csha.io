	<p>Hey, welcome to my personal page!</p>
	<p>
		I'm a freelance UX designer by day, and a neurodivergent anarcho-feminist by night. Just
		kidding, I'm neurodivergent af all the time. And since I usually only start working in the
		evening... you get the idea.
	</p>
	<p>
		I studied physics at <a href="https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en">MFF</a> where I was especially
		interested in Lagrangian, Hamiltonian and quantum mechanics, group theory and differential
		geometry. If you wanted to check out my bachlor's thesis,
		<a href="https://github.com/m93a/thesis-magnetic-transport">you can read here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		After that, I shortly studied humanities at <a href="https://fhs.cuni.cz/FHSENG-1.html">FHS</a>.
		Now, I'm picking up gardening & permaculture and hoping to grow a food forest!
	</p>
