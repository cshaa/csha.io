	<p>Hey, welcome to my personal page!</p>
	<p>
		I'm a freelance UX designer by day, a neurodivergent anarcho-feminist by night. Just kidding,
		I'm neurodivergent af all the time. And since I usually only start working in the evening... you
		get the idea.
	</p>
	<p>
		Currently, I study humanities at <a href="https://fhs.cuni.cz/FHSENG-1.html">FHS</a>. Before
		that, I studied physics at <a href="https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en">MFF</a> where I was interested
		especially Lagrangian, Hamiltonian and quantum mechanics, group theory and differential
		geometry. In my bachelor's thesis, which
		<a href="https://github.com/m93a/thesis-magnetic-transport">you can read here</a>, I
		analytically investigated the spectra (ie. allowed energies) of electrons in a homogeneous
		magnetic field and some kind of electrostatic field.
